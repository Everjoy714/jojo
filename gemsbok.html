                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <P>The gemsbok, or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival. </P>
                    <p>The average lifespan of gemsbok is approximately 18 years in the wild, and 20 in captivity. Main predators include lions, leopards and spotted hyenas. Cheetahs and jackals pose additional threats to young gemsbok.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE CAN WE FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <P>Gemsboks, also known as oryx, are primarily found in the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly the Kalahari Desert. They are not found in the northern regions of Botswana, like Chobe or the Okavango Delta, according to Botswana Wildlife Guide. </P>
