                    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group  known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes.</p>
                    <p>Monkey is the premier platform for live video chat, seamlessly connecting you with new people both locally and globally.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE ARE THEY FOUND?</strong></p>
                    <p>Monkeys are found in two main regions of the world: Africa and Asia (Old World monkeys), and Americas (New World monkeys). They are not native to North America, Europe, or Australia. </p>
