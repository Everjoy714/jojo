                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <P>The common warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, eastern Ethiopia. </P>
                    <p>Warthogs are also well-known for their two sets of tusksâ€”a pair of long, protruding lower tusks that measure around 15 centimetres (six inches) each and are used when fighting, and a pair of upper tusks that form a 60-centimetre  long semicircle.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE ARE THEY FOUND?</strong></p>
                    <P>Warthogs are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the savanna and grassland areas. They are native to the continent, with common warthogs inhabiting a wide range of savanna, grassland, and woodland habitats in the region.</P>
